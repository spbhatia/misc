- Mental walkthrough of troubleshooting methodology

**Practice Session (45 min): Full Mock Interview**

Simulate the actual interview format:

**Part 1: Fundamentals (10 min)**
Answer these out loud:
1. "Explain the difference between OSI and TCP/IP models"
2. "What happens when you type a URL and press Enter?" (Layer by layer)
3. "Explain how DNS resolution works"
4. "What's the difference between TCP and UDP?"

**Part 2: Troubleshooting Scenario (20 min)**
Pick one complex scenario and walk through it completely:
- "A user reports they can access some websites but not others. Walk me through your troubleshooting process."

Use your framework:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Start with Layer 1 (physical)
3. Work your way up methodically
4. Explain what you're checking at each step
5. Verbalize your thought process

**Part 3: Bash Scripting (20 min)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Solution approach

while read -r ip; do
    if ping -c 1 -W 1 "$ip" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "$ip is UP"
    else
        echo "$ip is DOWN"
    fi
done < ip_list.txt
```

**Review (15 min): Confidence Building**
- List your strengths
- Note: The interviewer wants to see your PROCESS, not perfection
- Remember: Ask clarifying questions when unsure
- Practice saying "I would check...", "Next I would..."

***

## **Critical Interview Tips (Based on Real Experiences)**
### **The Golden Rules**[3][2][4]
1. **Verbalize Your Thought Process**: Don't go silent. Say "Let me think through this..." and talk through your approach

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: This is encouraged! Examples:
   - "Is this affecting all users or just one?"
   - "When did this problem start?"
   - "Have there been any recent changes?"

3. **Use the OSI Model as Your Framework**: Interviewers LOVE when you say "I'll start with the physical layer and work my way up"[18][19]

4. **KISS Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - Don't overthink[4]

5. **Show Adaptability**: If stuck, explain what you'd do next: "I would check our documentation", "I would consult with a colleague", "I would review vendor documentation"

6. **For Bash Scripting**: They want solutions that WORK, not necessarily optimal[27]
   - Focus on correct logic
   - Comment your code
   - Handle basic error cases

***

## **Quick Reference Cheat Sheets**
### **OSI Model Troubleshooting Tools**[9][10]
| Layer | Tools to Use | What to Check |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 - Physical | Visual inspection, cable tester | Cables, link lights, power |
| 2 - Data Link | arp, show mac address-table | MAC addresses, switch ports, VLANs |
| 3 - Network | ping, traceroute, ip route | IP config, routing, connectivity |
| 4 - Transport | netstat, ss, telnet | Port status, connections |
| 5-7 - Upper | Application-specific, Wireshark | Service status, protocols |

### **Essential Bash Commands for Networking**[15][16][26]
```bash
# Connectivity
ping -c 4 hostname         # Send 4 packets
ping -W 1 hostname         # 1 second timeout

# Network info
ip addr show              # Show IP addresses
ip route show            # Show routing table
netstat -tuln            # Show listening ports
ss -s                    # Socket statistics

# Text processing (CRITICAL for scripting interview)
grep "pattern" file      # Search for pattern
awk '{print $1}' file    # Print first column
sed 's/old/new/' file    # Replace text
cat file | wc -l         # Count lines

# Loops
for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done
while read line; do echo $line; done < file

# Conditionals
if [ condition ]; then ... fi
[[ -f file ]] && echo "exists"
```
